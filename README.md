The goal is to analyze the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders
to help the marketing team design strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Tools Used
- R, tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2

## Project Steps
1. Data download and cleaning (Divvy 2019 Q1 & 2020 Q1)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical analysis (ride length, weekday trends, user type comparison)
4. Data visualization (using ggplot2 in RMarkdown)
5. Final report generation (.Rmd and .html files)

## Key Insights
- Casual riders take longer rides, mainly on weekends.
- Annual members ride more frequently during weekdays for commuting.
- Recommendations focus on weekend membership promotions, leisure-focused packages, and targeted digital marketing.
